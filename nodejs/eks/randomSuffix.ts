// Dynamic providers don't currently work well with multi-language components [1]. To workaround this, the
// dynamic providers in this library have been ported to be custom resources implemented by the new provider
// plugin. Previously, this functionality was implemented using a generic Transform<T, U> dynamic provider, which
// accepted a function that would be called when its `input` property changed and the result would be exported
// as an output. There was only one place in EKS where this was used to append a random suffix to a given input.
// Instead of reimplementing the general Transform resource as a custom resource in this provider, which would
// need to (de)serialize the function, this is a reimplementation of just the random suffix functionality needed
// for EKS. An alias is used and care has been taken in the implementation inside the provider to avoid any diffs
// for any existing stacks that were created using the old dynamic provider-based Transform for this.
